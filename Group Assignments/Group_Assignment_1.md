# **Closing Whiteman Airport: Spatializing environmental justice in Pacoima and small airport communities in Southern California**
### UP 206A | Winter 2021 | By: Tal & Angelica

#### **INTRODUCTION**   
Despite the fact that California’s economy ranks fifth in the world and is thought to house the most progressive environmental policies, many communities still face environmental injustices and are exposed to toxic substances which impact their health. The Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacoima, home to about 100,000 people - 85% Latinx and 7% Black - faces numerous environmental justice challenges ([L.A. Times, Mapping L.A.](http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/neighborhood/pacoima/)). The residents of Pacoima have historical exposure to environmental racism, a result of the freeways that surround the community, toxic release sites, landfills, lead in paint and the soil, and the municipal airport ([CARE Final Progress Report](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-08/documents/california_pacoima1_report-508.pdf)). In a survey conducted by Philliber and Associates from 2001-2005, over 20% of the residents in Pacoima reported to have asthma, and have some of the highest rates of asthma-related hospitalization in the state ([CARE Final Progress Report](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-08/documents/california_pacoima1_report-508.pdf)). Additionally, according to the OEHHA’s CalEnviroScreen 3.0 place-based cumulative impact screening tool, about 8 per 10,000 people visit the emergency room due to a heart attack, which is higher than 45% of other California census tracts ([OEHHA](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/maps-data)). Lastly, CalEnviroScreen 3.0 shows that Pacoima is in the 95th percentile--meaning that the residents living in Pacoima are more vulnerable to pollution than 95% of California ([OEHHA](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/maps-data)).

As a result of the multifaceted and significant pollution that exists in Pacoima, for our research project we will focus on examining the environmental and health impact of the Whiteman Airport and toxic clean-up sites. Since Pacoima residents are exposed to numerous sources of pollutants, it would be beyond the scope of the class and our capacity to understand how all of the pollutants intertwine. As a result, we would like to compare the health impact of Whiteman Airport on Pacoima residents to other communities in Southern California that have municipal airports. Additionally, since Pacoima has a high number of toxic cleanup sites, we would like to also assess how the close proximity to those sites impacts the health of the residents. 


#### **Research Questions**   
   * To what extent do health differences exist between Pacoima and other neighborhoods in Southern California due to air pollution exposure from small airports?
   * How does Whiteman Airport impact the health of Pacoima residents in comparison to other communities with small airports in Southern California?
   * How does close proximity to and density of toxic cleanup sites impact the health of Pacoima residents in comparison to other Southern California communities?

#### **IMPORTANCE**   
California was one of the first states in the nation to systematize environmental justice into statute. Yet despite this well-intentioned effort, communities of color and low-income communities continue to disproportionately live in toxic neighborhoods compared to white and higher-income populations. There are various studies and significant evidence to show the inequities in exposure and vulnerability to environmental pollutants based on race and socioeconomic status across California. It is crucial that we not only further quantify and analyze environmental racism in Pacoima, but recommend and implement equitable policies to ensure the health of communities. This project builds on the work that Pacoima Beautiful has undertaken for many years. The focus of the research project was determined based on the priorities listed in the ([CARE Final Progress Report](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-08/documents/california_pacoima1_report-508.pdf)) documented by Pacoima Beautiful and the federal EPA.

#### **METHODS**   
*Spatial scope*   
The spatial scope of the project is the neighborhood of Pacoima located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. We will compare Pacoima with additional communities in Southern California to examine how the communities differ in their environmental and health aspects. We chose Pacoima because the community has historically been economically and environmentally disenfranchised. However, there is a strong community presence through community-based organizations such as Pacoima Beautiful, which continue to advocate for equity and hold local and elected officials accountable. Space matters for this project because of the environmental justice component of living and exiting in Pacoima. Residents in the neighborhood are exposed to myriad toxics simply by living in their homes. Time is important for this project because of the importance to address the health impacts residents face. Many suffer from chronic health conditions - asthma, lung disease, heart disease, and cancer - exacerbated by continued exposure from Whiteman Airport and toxic cleanup sites. More affluent communities are not subject to the same exposures. In December 2020, the Los Angeles City Council voted to close the airport within 20 years. Our research will investigate whether the environmental justice and public health concerns support an expedited airport closure.

*Data Sources*   
As of right now, we have identified two data sources that we’ll be using for our analysis. First, we’ll be looking at asthma emergency department rates (per 10,000). The 2012 California Department of Public Health (CDPH) data set additionally contains the asthma rates by zip code for all age groups in California. In addition to the zip code, which we’ll use to identify the neighborhood of Pacoima, the dataset contains a spatial component. The second dataset that we’ll be using is the CalEnviroScreen 3.0, which contains spatial data on toxic clean up sites across the state. We’ll clean up the data in order to filter the communities that we’ll be analyzing for the research project.

#### **INSIGHTS**  
We hope our analysis will offer additional evidence regarding the health impact of environmental hazards on residents, specifically pollution from small airports in Southern California with special attention to Pacoima’s Whiteman Airport. We intend to collate and compile extant data and conduct spatial analysis in order to provide Pacoima Beautiful a visually impactful story of their community. Lastly, we hope that the project will be useful to community leaders in order to hold local officials accountable to environmental justice communities.
